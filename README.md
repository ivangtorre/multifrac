# multifractal-analysis-images

This is a plugin for ImageJ for multifractal analysis of 2D and 3D images.  
ImageJ can be download from its official site: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html

### INSTALLATION and USE

Copy the folder  "Multifractal soil analysis" to Imagej/plugins  
Open ImajeJ, load an image and the code will be under Plugins/Multifractal Soil Analysis  

There is a detailed manual for some of the multifractal analysis options which includes some computing analysis tests available by the end of the document:
* González Torre, I. (2014). Theory and application of multifractal analysis methods in images for the study of soil structure (Master thesis, Agronomica).

I am nowadays updating the plugin and I will release some test and documentation soon.
